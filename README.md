Welcome to the *most official* Onebot plugin for converting between units of time, length, mass, volume, and more.

## Configuration

Before you install the plugin, install [`convert-units`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/convert-units), a Node.js module, which I would use [`npm`](https://www.npmjs.com/get-npm) for. This is how this Onebot plugin converts units!

To let Onebot load this plugin, simply drag-and-drop `Short-URLs.obp.js` into your Onebot installation's plugin folder. Onebot automatically tries to create one if it doesn't exist when you start it up, but if that doesn't happen, create `./plugins`.
